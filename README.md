# Cat Orphanage Application
For my application, I have decided on making a program that helps in assigning cats into compatible
foster homes. The program will have multiple functionalities: it will store all cats belonging to the shelter,
store all fosters working for the shelter, assign cats into compatible foster homes and so on, aswell as a myriad of
evolving other functionalities. However, the main purpose of the program is to help in determining compatible
foster homes for new cats, as well as cats that haven't found a home yet.

This application is meant to be used by a foster shelter for cats. Specifically it is meant to be able to help the 
process of assigning cats to foster families, as many databases current foster shelters have are outdated and lack
functionality. There are virtually no automated systems to my knowledge that check for compatibility of fosters,
as it is generally a manual process. This project was personally of interest to me, since from when I was 8 years old I 
have been a volunteer for a kitten orphanage rescue named VOKRA, where my family was also a foster for many years.
I along with this, saw how certain cats were put into less than ideal homes, for reasons such as cats sometimes needing
another cat to live with. I felt like this problem is one that is a fixable one, and there is no better way than
to automate it, as well as provide even further functionality to aid in helping the orphanage, fosters, and cats.

In order to run the application, run Main, either running the console or GUI version. Then you will be able to start
your registry, adding cats and fosters, and assigning fosters to cats deemed eligible based on the compatability of
the foster with the cats that are yet to have a foster. Additionally, you can save and upload the information from your
registry from/to a file via the command center, allowing you to keep your registry information without having to 
reenter after the application has closed.
